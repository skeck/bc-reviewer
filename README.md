# bc-reviewer

This repository is a **testing implementation** of a Business Central AI Reviewer:
[AidentErfurt/bc-ai-reviewer](https://github.com/AidentErfurt/bc-ai-reviewer).

Purpose:
- Verify the reviewer action works end-to-end in CI.
- Exercise different providers/models (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, OpenRouter).
- Demonstrate how the action looks when running on real pull requests.
